INT. HOPES PEAK CLASSROOM 1-C - DAY

**FADE FROM WHITE**

The first thing we see is Cat's eyeball, staring up at us.  We continue to zoom out until it's clear she's lying on the floor of a classroom with black and white checkerboard tiles. 

CAT (V.O.)
You know when you forget something, but you forgot what it was you forgot? Like you head to work - thinking that you must have left your keys or mobile or shoes behind or something. You don't know exactly what it is - but whatever it is - it is important. Life or death important. That's the best way I can describe what I felt that first moment, lying there on the classroom floor, not knowing where I was, or how I got there. Whatever it was, it gave me a raging headache. 

CAT
Ow. Bloody mothering...

Cat stands up and looks around. She hears FOOTSTEPS in the distance. 

CAT
OY! Can you hear me?  I think... I think I...

Cat grunts in frustration

CAT
I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am, and I need help!  My name's Catherine Wilson... please... I think -- I think I need help.  It's like I've been... roofied or something. I think I need to get to a hospital!  

Cat turns around, and we see the perspective shift with her - there's a classroom blackboard that we now see, with a message: "If you wake up, stay here. We've all been kidnapped and we're searching around for a way out. Jaime will be back to check on you soon - wait ten minutes, if he's not there, meet us in the gymnasium. -- Wayne"

CAT 
No... no. no. NO!

Cat SCREAMS. The FOOTSTEPS get louder and more rapid, and Jaime bursts into the room, huffing and puffing. 

JAIME 
Are you alright, mon amie [moan-a-me]? 

Cat GASPS

CAT
No... no, I'm not bloody alright!

JAIME
Yeah, we're all feeling that right now. I mean, are you injured?

CAT 
Uh... no.  No, I mean, I've got a massive headache, but other than that I seem to be okay.  Where are you?  Who are we? I mean, who is... what is?  Why is the everything wrong!

JAIME 
I think you may want to sit down. 

CAT 
Alright...

JAIME 
Okay... I'll take a seat too, if you don't mind, while I answer your questions - well, answer somewhat.  My name's Jay. Short for Jaime, Jaime Martin.  What's yours? 

CAT
It's Cat. Short for Catherine Wilson. 

JAIME
By any chance, Cat, you are a student at Hopes Peak Academy? 

CAT
Well, I was accepted.  I haven't started classes yet.  How were you able to guess?

JAIME
Ah, yes. That seems to be something the nine of us have in common. All have some sort of extraordinary talent. If you don't mind, may I ask yours? 

CAT
They called me the Ultimate Bartender.  Yeah, I know, it's a weird talent. 

JAIME
Ah. Je suis le DJ ultime. EnchantÃ©[on-chont-ay]. 

> TITLE CARD: JAIME MARTIN, Ultimate DJ < 

JAIME
Anyway, here's what we know.  Including you and me, there are nine of us - we all woke up here, presumably kidnapped, and can't remember anything about how we got here. One of the things we had in common was that we had all been accepted to study at the Hopes Peak Academy facility recently. 

CAT
Yeah, I remember being invited, but... I don't think I was supposed to start yet?  

JAIME
Same here. But I think that some time has passed beyond what we remember. My hair, for example.  

CAT
What's wrong with your hair? 

JAIME
It's much longer than it is supposed to be.  I always wanted to wear my hair long - but I always had to cut it short for one job or another.  Maddie also said she had a tattoo that she didn't remember getting.  Niki said that her ear piercings had healed over... Wayne said that he has an appendix scar, but never remembered getting his appendix removed. 

CAT
Oh my god... 

JAIME
What is it? 

CAT
My nails are painted. And long.

JAIME
I take it you never painted your nails? 

CAT
Yeah, I usually keep my nails short, you don't want to get bar rot. Sorry - that's my job.  I'm a bartender, bar rot is sores you get from your hands being wet all the time. 

JAIME 
I see.  

CAT 
Wayne? 

JAIME 
One of the other students here. He's the only one of us who managed to become calm quickly and come up with a plan. The rest of us didn't know how to do anything with our ten fingers. Anyway, we decided to let you have a fat morning. Whatever hit us, seems to have hit you particularly hard, you were asleep a long time.

CAT 
Ah.  English isn't your first language is it?

JAIME 
Yeah, the idioms, I still have problems sometimes. Strangely, that's another thing. I speak and understand English much easier that I remember. No, I was raised in Lyon, France. Et vous?

CAT 
I'm from London.  I took French in school, but I was never any good at it.  Sorry. Speaking of school, you said "other students"?

JAIME
Oui. We're all very different, but we all have one thing in common.  One of the last things we remember is that we all enrolled at Hope's Peak Academy.  The rest is... mud, at best. 

CAT
That's... yeah, that's all I remember too.  Last thing I remember clearly is when that scout came into my bar... 

JAIME 
Your bar? 

CAT 
Yeah.  Funny story, I'm a bartender, and that's why I got invited to study at Hope's Peak.  Apparently, bartending is a talent, and it's one they wanted to foster for some reason. 

JAIME 
Ah, yes, I think to be honest, I will be staying away from wine and spirits for the moment - my head also hurts greatly.  So with you, that confirms it - all of us are Hope's Peak Students.  And apparently, our prison is some sort of school building. Complete with all the acoutremonts.  

CAT 
Weird. 

JAIME 
Yes, well, weirdness is relative. 

CAT 
Yeah... wait, what?

JAIME 
Have you looked out the windows yet? 

CAT 
No... no, I haven't. 

JAIME 
I think you should. 

CAT looks to the windows in the classroom. 

CAT (V.O.)
On first glance, it looked like the windows were some sort of frosted glass, or translucent plastic - but no, it was a normal window.  And on the other side?  Fog.  Impossibly thick fog. 

CAT 
You know, my Nan used to tell me about fog this thick back in the 1950s, but I've never seen anything like it myself. 

JAIME
Yes, well, to jump from the rooster to the donkey, we should probably meet up with the others. They'll want to know that you're awake and healthy. Oh. Mind the forcefield. 

CAT
Wait, what forcefield?
